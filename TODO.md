# COLLECTIPY TODOlist

## check inter process detection
## check collision detector zip log issue
## check dimensions congruency. resolve multiple discording values by alphabetic order. config input overwrite values -> congruency must apply over shapes logging warning and using if given resolved input by which dimensions are set. ex: radius and diamter must agree if needed, as width and height and depth in cube etc...
